# Overview: A Graph in Python

This is a library for a data structure called __Graph__, all written in Python. <br />
The Graph is non-oriented and implemented by adjacency matrix. <br />
__Disclaimer:__ I am still developing the library, so I do not recommend to use it. What you can do for now is to have a look at the test I am providing. <br />

## Execute on Windows

```shell
.\build.bat
```

## Execute on Linux
